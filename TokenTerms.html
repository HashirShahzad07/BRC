Company may also request certain optional information, such as an email address, through the web interface. More information about Token Distribution will be made available on The Website. The Company reserves the right to give users access to their own Wallet via an online system, or recommend/require users to obtain their own Wallet through a third party system in order to receive their Tokens purchased during the Token Sale Period.</p>
  
    <p>If the Company permits, their web application will then provide you with a unique deposit address for the deposit of your cryptocurrency. Once the unique deposit address has received Appropriate Cryptocurrencies from you as consideration for Tokens, Company will authorize the Smart Contract System to deliver Tokens to the wallet address that you provided to Company for delivery of the Tokens after the end of the Token sale period. Or the Wallet provided to you by The Company. The Smart Contract System is deployed by Company from The Marshal Islands, and is programmed so that all transactions it executes will be executed in the excluded countries. As such, title to, and risk of loss of, Tokens delivered by the Smart Contract System passes from Company to purchasers internationally. The Company may refuse to send tokens to those individuals based in The Marshal Islands.</p>
  
    <p>The Company anticipates that delivery of The Tokens from the Company to purchasers will occur within three weeks after the Sale Period concludes, but reserves the right to delay delivery up to four or five weeks after the conclusion of the Sale Period. Although the Company does not anticipate any security issues arising from the sale of Tokens, this four week time frame is intended as a precautionary buffer period for Company to conduct audit procedures and to resolve any such security issues.</p>
  
    <h1>Token Allocation</h1>
  
    <p>The Company anticipates the following Token allocation among the contributors.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Seed</li>
      <li>Private A</li>
      <li>Private B</li>
      <li>IDO</li>
      <li>Team</li>
      <li>Marketing</li>
      <li>Advisors</li>
      <li>R&D</li>
      <li>Liquidity & MM</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>BRCStarter Tokens not sold during the Sale Period will be retained by the Company (the “Retained Tokens”) and allocated to the R&D Fund.</p>
  
    <p>The Company currently anticipates using the Token from R&D Fund to distribute to new users, compensate employees (including salaries and non-salary compensation), to fund future development of the Network, provide grants to (or purchase equity stakes in) third-parties working on projects in the The Company ecosystem, donate Token to non-profit entities, and support general development of the The Company ecosystem. These anticipated purposes are listed for illustration only, and Company reserves the right to use R&D Fund Token for these purposes (or others) at its sole discretion.</p>
    <h1>Tokens Sale Proceeds Retained by Founders and Existing Early Backers</h1>

    <p>Except to the extent paid as compensation for work performed for the Company, neither the founders nor the existing backers, supporters, and certain users of the Company and its network, services and products will receive Retained Token from Company or any amount of the Cryptocurrencies that are used to purchase Token from Company during the Sale Period other than the percentages listed as part of the breakdown contained in the Terms of Sale.</p>
  
    <h1>Pre-Sales of Tokens</h1>
  
    <p>The Company has committed to sell a certain portion of Token before the Launch Date (“Token PreSales”). Under such Token Sale arrangements, by agreeing to pay Company for The Company before the Launch Date, a Token Pre-Sale purchaser purchased Tokens at a discounted rate. Token Pre-Sale purchasers, and others such as contractors or other service providers, must acknowledge and agree to be bound by these Terms, and receive Tokens pursuant to the procedures for receiving Tokens set forth in this Exhibit B, but must consent to receiving Tokens in a time-locked smart contract that will not permit further disposition of the Tokens for a certain period of time thereafter (which is generally in the range of 3 to 4 months after receipt). The discounts and time-lock periods under The Token Pre-Sale arrangements generally depended on the amount of Tokens that the Pre-Sale purchaser agreed to purchase or the services for which contractors have provided.</p>
  
    <h1>Use of Proceeds from Token Sale</h1>
  
    <p>The USDT, USDC & BNB proceeds from Company’s sale of Tokens will be used to compensate technical and non-technical staff, cover marketing & legal costs and operating expenses, and develop technical infrastructure, among other purposes. The envisioned expenditures and areas of development described above are provided for illustrative purposes only, and Company reserves the right to allocate its resources, including proceeds from the sale of Tokens toward such areas of development at its sole discretion.</p>
  
    <h1>Acknowledgment and Assumption of Risks</h1>
  
    <h2>Certain Risk Factors Relating to Purchase, Sale and Use of Tokens</h2>
  
    <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the Tokens are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this Exhibit C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Reliance on any information contained in this Exhibit C.</li>
      <li>Any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information.</li>
      <li>Any action resulting from such information.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>By purchasing, holding and using Tokens, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:</p>
  
    <h2>Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s)</h2>
  
    <p>A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet storing Tokens will result in loss of such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tokens.</p>
  
    <h2>Risks Associated with the Blockchain Networks (such as Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum)</h2>
  
    <p>Because BRCStarter Tokens and the Network are based on the blockchain network (Binance Smart Chain or Ethereum), any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the blockchain network may have a material adverse effect on the Network or Tokens. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to the Tokens and the Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the blockchain network.</p>
  
    <h2>Risk of Mining Attacks</h2>
  
    <p>As with other decentralized cryptographic Tokens based on the Binance Smart Chain protocol, the Tokens are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Token transactions on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the Network and the Tokens, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tokens.</p>
    <h1>Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses</h1>

    <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Network or the Tokens in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, treasury vulnerability, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, man in the middle, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Network is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Network, which could negatively affect the Network and the Tokens.</p>
  
    <p>Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal the Cryptocurreneies as collected from the Token sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of The Company to develop the Tokens and the Platform and operate the Network. To account for this risk, The Company has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to safeguard the proceeds obtained from the sale of BRCStarter Tokens. As acknowledged, there is always a risk that the The Company Team, or other third parties not directly affiliated with the Parties, may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Token Platform causing the system to lose Tokens stored in one or more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued Tokens issued on the Platform. The Company has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the Platform, and will continue to do so after the initial sale. For example, The Company intends to hire external consultants to assess and audit the security of the Smart Contracts. As acknowledged by both parties, advances in code cracking, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the Platform, which could result in the theft or loss of Tokens or other valuable assets. As with other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the Platform is susceptible to mining attacks, among others. The purchase of Tokens carries with these significant risks. Prior to purchasing Tokens, the Purchaser should carefully consider the risks herein identified, and, to the extent necessary, consult experts of your choosing ( cryptographic and cyber security specialists, lawyers, accountants, and/or other professionals) prior to determining whether to purchase Tokens.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Associated with Markets for Tokens</h1>
  
    <p>The Tokens are intended to be used solely within the Network, and Company will not support or otherwise facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Tokens. This restricts the contemplated avenues for using Tokens to the provision or receipt of Services, and could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to the Tokens you hold. Even if secondary trading of Tokens is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud or manipulation.</p>
  
    <p>Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tokens (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>
  
    <h1>Risk of Uninsured Losses</h1>
  
    <p>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions</h1>
  
    <p>The regulatory status of the Tokens and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications, including the Network and the Tokens. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including the Network and the Tokens. Regulatory actions could negatively impact the Network and the Tokens in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tokens are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Arising from Taxation</h1>
  
    <p>The tax characterization of Tokens is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tokens, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.</p>
  
    <h1>Risk of Alternative Networks</h1>
  
    <p>It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying the Network and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. The Network may compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Network and Tokens.</p>
    <h1>Risk of Insufficient Interest in the Network or Distributed Applications</h1>

    <p>It is possible that the Network will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies, and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems (such as the Network) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of the Network and therefore the potential utility of Tokens.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of the Network</h1>
  
    <p>The Network is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for the Tokens and Network to follow the specifications set forth in our Terms and Conditions, and throughout our site, and intend to take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of the BRCStarter Tokens or Network for any number of legitimate reasons.</p>
  
    <p>This could create the risk that the Tokens or Network, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchase. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain the Network, it is still possible that the Network will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the Network and Tokens.</p>
  
    <h1>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether, BNB, and Other Currency Value</h1>
  
    <p>The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling Tokens to fund the maintenance and development of the Network, as described further in the Terms of Sale. The proceeds of the Tokens sale will be denominated in USDT, USDT, BNB, Ether, or Bitcoin, and converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. In addition, some pre-sales of the Tokens may also be denominated in fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the Network in the manner that it intended.</p>
  
    <h1>Risk of Dissolution of the Company or Network</h1>
  
    <p>It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in the Tokens’ utility, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Network may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights</h1>
  
    <p>Because The Company confers no governance rights of any kind with respect to the Network or Company or its corporate affiliates, all decisions involving the Network or Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue the Network, to create and sell more Tokens for use in the Network, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect the Network and the Tokens you hold.</p>
  
    <h1>Risks Involving Cloud Storage</h1>
  
    <p>As the Company provides services to individual and institutional clients, including users and applications which involve data storage to some extent, the Services are susceptible to a number of risks related to the storage of data in the cloud. While the Company does not have access to the contents of the data stored through the Services, the Services may involve the storage of large amounts of sensitive and/or proprietary information, which may be compromised in the event of a cyber-attack or other malicious activity. Similarly, the Services may be interrupted, and files may become temporarily unavailable in the event of such an attack or malicious activity. Because users can use a variety of hardware and software that may interface with the Network, there is the risk that the Services may become unavailable or interrupted based on a failure of interoperability or an inability to integrate these third-party systems and devices that the Company does not control with the Company’s Services. The risk that the Services may face increasing interruptions and the Network may face additional security vulnerabilities could adversely affect the Network and therefore the future utility of any Tokens that you hold.</p>
    <h1>Unanticipated Risks</h1>

    <p>Cryptographic Tokens such as Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Exhibit C, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of Tokens, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit C.</p>
