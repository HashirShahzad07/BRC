    <h1>General</h1>
    <p>These terms and conditions (“Terms”) govern the use of the Site (defined below) and the Services (defined below). These Terms also include any guidelines, announcements, additional terms, policies, and disclaimers made available or issued by us from time to time. These Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between BRCSTARTER Platform LTD. and its affiliates (“BRCStarter”, “we”, “us”) and you, an end user of the services (“you” or “User”) at https://BRCStarter.net/ (“Services”). By accessing, using or clicking on our website (and all related subdomains) or its mobile applications (“Site”) or accessing, using or attempting to use the Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and to are bound by these Terms and that you comply with the requirements listed herein. If you do not agree to all of these Terms or comply with the requirements herein, please do not access or use the Site or the Services. In addition, when using some features of the Services, you may be subject to specific additional terms and conditions applicable to those features. We may modify, suspend or discontinue the Site or the Services at any time and without notifying you. We may also change, update, add or remove provisions of these Terms from time to time. Any and all modifications or changes to these Terms will become effective upon publication on our Site or release to Users. Therefore, your continued use of our Services is deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms and rules. If you do not agree to any changes to these Terms, please do not access or use the Site or the Services. We note that these Terms between you and us do not enumerate or cover all rights and obligations of each party, and do not guarantee full alignment with needs arising from future development. Therefore, our privacy policy which can be viewed at the “Privacy Policy” link at the bottom of our Site, platform rules, guidelines and all other agreements entered into separately between you and us are deemed supplementary terms that are an integral part of these Terms and shall have the same legal effect. Your use of the Site or Services is deemed your acceptance of any supplementary terms too.</p>
    <h1>Eligibility</h1>
    <p>By registering to use a BRCStarter account (“Account”) or using the Services, you represent and warrant that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As an individual, legal person, or other organization, you have full legal capacity and authority to agree and bind yourself to these Terms.</li>
  <li>You are at least 18 or are of legal age to form a binding contract under applicable laws.</li>

  <li>You have not been previously suspended or removed from using our Services.</li>
  <li>If you act as an employee or agent of a legal entity and enter into these Terms on their behalf, you represent and warrant that you have all the necessary rights and authorizations to bind such a legal entity.</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the use of the Services and, if applicable, for all activities that occur on or through your user account.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Identity Verification</h1>
<p>Given that BRCStarter is a permissionless and fully decentralized platform for token sales, we have no role in enforcing anti-money laundering (“AML”) and know-your-customer checks (“KYC”) by default. We, however, understand the need of some token projects to require AML and KYC procedures on their token sale participants and we do provide AML and KYC tools for fundraising entities using BRCStarter to enforce such procedures on their users, if the token projects choose to do so at their own discretion. The token projects will determine whether any User will satisfy the AML and KYC procedures in their absolute sole discretion.</p>

<p>Please note that we cannot control, nor will we be liable or responsible for, the AML and KYC procedures to be conducted by the token projects, the safekeeping of any AML and KYC documentation or a breach of any AML and KYC laws, rules or regulations thereof, or any other act or omission pertaining to it and any token project’s compliance with applicable privacy laws or regulations. We advise you to read our privacy policy and the respective privacy policy of any relevant third party and use your best discretion.</p>

<p>We and our affiliates may, but are not obligated to, collect and verify information about you in order to keep appropriate record of our customers, protect us and the community from fraudulent users, and identify traces of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other financial crimes, or for other lawful purposes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing your name, email address, phone number and country of residence;</li>
  <li>certifying that you are 18 years or older;</li>
  <li>accepting the terms of use and privacy policy; and</li>
  <li>verifying your identity by submitting the following documentation (BRCStarter reserves the right to request additional information as needed):
    <ul>
      <li>a government-issued ID with your full name, date of birth and social security number (or identification number);</li>
      <li>an address proof stating your current physical address; and</li>
      <li>a selfie picture from your webcam or mobile phone.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Notwithstanding the above minimum verification procedures, we may require you to provide or verify additional information before permitting you to use any Service. We may refuse, in its sole discretion, to open an Account for you. We may also: (a) suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any or all of the Services; (b) deactivate or cancel your Account; or (c) blacklist you from opening any future Accounts with us, if we reasonably suspect you of using your Account in connection with any prohibited use or business; your use of your Account or our Services is subject to any pending litigation, investigation, or government proceeding and/or we perceive a heightened risk of legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your activity; or you take any action that we deem as circumventing our controls, including, but not limited to, opening multiple accounts or abusing promotions which we may offer from time to time.</p>

<p>In addition to providing such information, you agree to allow us to keep a record of that information during the period for which your account is active and within five (5) years after your account is closed. You also authorize us to share your submitted information and documentation to third parties to verify the authenticity of such information. We may also conduct necessary investigations directly or through a third party to verify your identity or protect you and/or us from financial crimes, such as fraud, and to take necessary action based on the results of such investigations. We will collect, use and share such information in accordance with our privacy policy.</p>

<p>After registration, you must ensure that the information is true, complete, and timely updated when changed. If there are any grounds for believing that any of the information you provided is incorrect, false, outdated or incomplete, we reserve the right to send you a notice to demand correction, directly delete the relevant information, and as the case may be, terminate all or part of the Services we provide for you. You shall be fully liable for any loss or expense caused to us during your use of the Services. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you have the obligation to keep all the information accurate, update and correct at all times.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to confiscate any and all funds that are found to be in violation of relevant and applicable AML or CFT laws and regulations, and to cooperate with the competent authorities when and if necessary.</p>

  <p>Any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms is personal to you and us and will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. There will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, a dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.</p>

  <p>Any dispute that is not resolved after good faith negotiations may be resolved by arbitration administered by an Arbitration Body sitting in the Republic of Marshal Islands.

  <p>As limited by these Terms and Arbitration rules, the arbitrator(s) will have (i) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute, including the determination of whether a dispute is arbitrable, and (ii) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator(s) may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.</p>
  <h1>Severability</h1>

  <p>If any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or other competent authority to be unlawful or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will continue in effect.</p>

  <p>If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would be lawful or enforceable if part of it were deleted, that part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the provision will continue in effect (unless that would contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be deleted).</p>
